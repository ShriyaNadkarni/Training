   <p><dfn><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML </abbr></dfn>  stands for <i>HyperText Markup Language.</i> It is used to design web pages using a markup language.</p>
   <br>
   <pre> 
        HTML is a combination of <b>Hypertext and Markup language </b>. 
        <strong>Hypertext defines the link between web pages.</strong>
        A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. 
        This language is used to annotate <del>(make notes for the computer) </del> so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly.
        Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are <u>human-readable</u>. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. </pre>

    <p>A balloon is a flexible bag that can be inflated with a gas, such as helium, hydrogen, nitrous oxide, oxygen, and air. For special tasks, balloons can be filled with smoke, liquid water, granular media (e.g. sand, flour or rice), or light sources. Modern day balloons are made from materials such as rubber, latex, polychloroprene, or a nylon fabric, and can come in many different colors. Some early balloons were made of dried animal bladders, such as the pig bladder. Some balloons are used for decorative purposes or entertaining purposes, while others are used for practical purposes such as meteorology, medical treatment, military defense, or transportation. <wbr> A balloon's properties, including its low density and low cost, have led to a wide range of applications.The rubber balloon was invented by Michael Faraday in 1824, during experiments with various gases. He invented them for use in the lab.[1]</p>
